## Advanced Smart Contracts: ERC20 Token Development & Deployment with AI Testing

**Welcome to the Advanced Smart Contracts repository! This repository covers advanced techniques for developing secure, reliable, and efficient smart contracts. It includes an in-depth tutorial on creating, deploying, and testing an ERC20 token using Solidity. The project leverages best practices, the OpenZeppelin framework, and AI-powered test automation, offering you a robust foundation for ERC20 token development. Dive in to learn about Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), ERC standards, and how to harness AI to simplify and optimize testing smart contracts.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
